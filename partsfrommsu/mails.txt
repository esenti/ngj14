Dear Eric,
we have to act. The agency went crazy,
everyone who sends an email with any of their
?chosen? words might be soon ?dead?.
I sent you some software:
an algorithm marks ?dangerous? words,
and two ?viruses? that eat charcters from
agencies stream.
Try not to leak anything, but at least be sure
marked words wont pass. 

Best regards,
?Merlin?

Dear ?Stephanie?,
my heard is like ?burst? wiht some ?SEMTEX?.
I cannot keeep this ?conspiracy? any longer.
I LOVE YOU.
Evertything in you, your ?face?, your hair,
even your ?sneakers? painted in flowers.
I can only hope, you feel the same.
If so, maybe i could take you for the newest
?Pixar? movie?

Trully yours,
?Bob?

Eric,
I think I got into their trap.
I assume I will be soon found as ?victim?
of some ?lethal incident?. Or rather my
?corpse? will never be found.
I also think their ?firewall? will get some
?response? for my ?viruses? very soon, and 
these will loose most of their effectivenes.
Your on your own.
Act ?smart?, fight this ?threat? for
?freedom?, and do not get ?killed?.

I hope we will meet again,
?Merlin?
